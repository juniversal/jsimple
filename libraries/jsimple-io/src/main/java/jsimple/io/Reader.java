 * The base class for all readers. A reader is a means of reading data from a source in a character-wise manner.
 * <p/>
 * This abstract class does not provide a fully working implementation, so it needs to be subclassed, and at least the
 * {@link #read(char[], int, int)} and {@link #close()} methods needs to be overridden. Overriding some of the
 * non-abstract methods is also often advised, since it might result in higher efficiency.
