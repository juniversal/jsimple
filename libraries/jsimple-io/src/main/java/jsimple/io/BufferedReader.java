/**
 * This class was based on, and modified from, the Apache Harmony java.io.BufferedReader class.  This class supports
 * mark and reset, while the base JSimple Reader class doesn't; unlike standard Java there's no markSupported method
 * since the only Reader that may support mark/reset--BufferedReader--always supports it.  Also, unlike the standard
 * BufferedReader, this class isn't synchronized & thus isn't thread safe--the caller needs to synchronize if required.
 * Basically, this class has these purposes in life: (1) Add buffering, though that's not required as much since
 * Utf8InputStreamReader has a little 1K buffer built in and StringReader is one huge buffer (2) Add mark & reset
 * support, so you can "unread" stuff and (3) add readLine (which requires unreading the get the line terminators
 * right).
 * <p/>
 * Wraps an existing {@link Reader} and <em>buffers</em> the input. Expensive interaction with the underlying reader is
 * minimized, since most (smaller) requests can be satisfied by accessing the buffer alone. The drawback is that some
 * extra space is required to hold the buffer and that copying takes place when filling that buffer, but this is usually
 * outweighed by the performance benefits.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>A typical application pattern for the class looks like this:
 * <pre>
 * BufferedReader buf = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.java"));
 * </pre>
