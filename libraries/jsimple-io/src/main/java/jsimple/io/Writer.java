/**
 * This class was based on, and modified from, the Apache Harmony java.io.Writer class.  Unlike the standard Java Writer
 * class, this doesn't do locking and doesn't throw any checked exceptions.
 * <p/>
 * The base class for all writers. A writer is a means of writing data to a target in a character-wise manner. Most
 * output streams expect the {@link #flush()} method to be called before closing the stream, to ensure all data is
 * actually written out.
 * <p/>
 * This abstract class does not provide a fully working implementation, so it needs to be subclassed, and at least the
 * {@link #write(char[], int, int)}, {@link #close()} and {@link #flush()} methods needs to be overridden. Overriding
 * some of the non-abstract methods is also often advised, since it might result in higher efficiency.
