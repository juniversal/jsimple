/**
 * This class was based on, and modified from, the Apache Harmony java.io.OutputStream class.  Unlike the standard Java
 * OutputStream class, this doesn't throw any checked exceptions.
 * <p/>
 * The base class for all output streams. An output stream is a means of writing data to a target in a byte-wise manner.
 * Most output streams expect the {@link #flush()} method to be called before closing the stream, to ensure all data is
 * actually written through.
 * <p/>
 * This abstract class does not provide a fully working implementation, so it needs to be subclassed, and at least the
 * {@link #write(int)} method needs to be overridden. Overriding some of the non-abstract methods is also often advised,
 * since it might result in higher efficiency.
