/**
 * The wrapper for the primitive type {@code char}. This class also provides a number of utility methods for working
 * with characters.
 * <p/>
 * Character data is based upon the Unicode Standard, 4.0. The Unicode specification, character tables and other
 * information are available at <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">http://www.unicode.org/</a>.
 * <p/>
 * Unicode characters are referred to as <i>code points</i>. The range of valid code points is U+0000 to U+10FFFF. The
 * <i>Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)</i> is the code point range U+0000 to U+FFFF. Characters above the BMP are referred
 * to as <i>Supplementary Characters</i>. On the Java platform, UTF-16 encoding and {@code char} pairs are used to
 * represent code points in the supplementary range. A pair of {@code char} values that represent a supplementary
 * character are made up of a <i>high surrogate</i> with a value range of 0xD800 to 0xDBFF and a <i>low surrogate</i>
 * with a value range of 0xDC00 to 0xDFFF.
 * <p/>
 * On the Java platform a {@code char} value represents either a single BMP code point or a UTF-16 unit that's part of a
 * surrogate pair. The {@code int} type is used to represent all Unicode code points.
