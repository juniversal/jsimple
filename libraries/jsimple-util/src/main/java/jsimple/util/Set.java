     * kind of equality they want.
     * <p/>
     * As background:  This behavior differs from the standard java.util.AbstractSet.equals method, where two sets are
     * considered equal if the have the same number of elements and those elements are equals, according to equals.
     * That's so-called deep equality.   Whereas C#, on the other hand, just does reference equality by default for
     * sets, saying two are equal if their references are equals.
     * <p/>
     * There are two main reasons we differ from standard Java and don't support equals here for collection classes:
     * <p/>
     * (a) The desired semantics are ambiguous (deep, shallow, or reference equality?  set type matter?). Different
     * semantics are appropriate in different cases. (b) It's hard to implement the Java semantics and support generics,
     * with covariance, properly and have it work with Java to C#/Swift translation.  Limited C# and Swift support for
     * covariance, especially when casting from an Object, makes it all the harder. So best to just avoid all those
     * issues & make the developer do explicitly what they want, calling some other method.
     *
     * @param object the object to compare to this object.
     * @return {@code true} if the specified object is equal to this set, {@code false} otherwise; though by default
     * this method throws an exception and developers generally shouldn't use equals on collections
