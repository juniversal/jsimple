/**
 * {@code Collection} is the root of the collection hierarchy. It defines operations on data collections and the
 * behavior that they will have in all implementations of {@code Collection}s.
 * <p/>
 * All direct or indirect implementations of {@code Collection} should implement at least two constructors. One with no
 * parameters which creates an empty collection and one with a parameter of type {@code Collection}. This second
 * constructor can be used to create a collection of different type as the initial collection but with the same
 * elements. Implementations of {@code Collection} cannot be forced to implement these two constructors but at least all
 * implementations under {@code java.util} do.
 * <p/>
 * Methods that change the content of a collection throw an {@code UnsupportedOperationException} if the underlying
 * collection does not support that operation, though it's not mandatory to throw such an {@code Exception} in cases
 * where the requested operation would not change the collection. In these cases it's up to the implementation whether
 * it throws an {@code UnsupportedOperationException} or not.
 * <p/>
 * Methods marked with (optional) can throw an {@code UnsupportedOperationException} if the underlying collection
 * doesn't support that method.
 * <p/>
 * A subclass must implement the abstract methods {@code iterator()} and {@code size()} to create an immutable
 * collection. To create a modifiable collection it's necessary to override the {@code add()} method that currently
 * throws an {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 * <p/>
 * Changes from the java.lang version:
 * <p/>
 * <T> void toArray(T[] contents) requires an array of the right size to be passed in, never allocating the array. That
 * avoids the need for reflection & was the most efficient option for using that method anyway.
 * <p/>
 * The contains and remove methods take an E instead of an Object as a parameter.   Logically, this makes more sense, is
 * more type safe, and is consistent with C#.   This change avoids some generic casting issues.
