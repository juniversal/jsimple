/**
 * A {@code List} is a collection which maintains an ordering for its elements. Every element in the {@code List} has an
 * index. Each element can thus be accessed by its index, with the first index being zero. Normally, {@code List}s allow
 * duplicate elements, as compared to Sets, where elements have to be unique.
 * <p/>
 * {@code AbstractList} is an abstract implementation of the {@code List} interface, optimized for a backing store which
 * supports random access. This implementation does not support adding or replacing. A subclass must implement the
 * abstract methods {@code get()} and {@code size()}, and to create a modifiable {@code List} it's necessary to override
 * the {@code add()} method that currently throws an {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 * <p/>
 * Changes from the java.lang version: Removed subList method.   It's rarely used (in my experience) and eliminated a
 * fair amount of code/complexity.
