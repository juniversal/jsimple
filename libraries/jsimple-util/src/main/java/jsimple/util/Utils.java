     * Return an array of bytes containing as elements this method's parameters.  Parameters are ints but they should be
     * in a legal range for a byte (technically -128 to 127, but treating the range like 0-255 also works as expected).
     * <p/>
     * This method exists mostly to avoid casting problems populating a byte[] literals inline--casting issues caused by
     * integer literals always being ints not bytes in Java (and thus requiring a byte cast--compile issue #1) and
     * translated C# always treating hex literals as unsigned and not allowing ones > 127 to be cast to (signed) bytes
     * (compile issue #2). Anyway, that's all avoided just by passing in ints here.
